# odin-admin-dashboard

This project is part of the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.  

The aim of this project is to build a full dashboard design, primarily focusing on using CSS Grid and demonstrating a good understanding of it. I will work from a provided project design file which gives a rough idea of what to aim for in regards to how it should look.  

NOTE: The primary focus of this project is to show a good understanding of CSS Grid, so I will be using grid in as many places as possible, even if something could be done much easier using flexbox or other methods.
